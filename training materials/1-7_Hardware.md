## Mobile data collection: smartphones

*When planning to use OpenDataKit:*

Most any Android smartphone will do, as long as it has a relative modern Android version (4.1+).

*When planning to use OpenMapKit:*

To enable OpenMapKit to run fluently and be able to handle larger background maps (in 'mbtiles' format) and OSM data, please make sure that phones have:
* At least 2 GB of RAM
* Preferably 16 GB of storage
* A modern Android version (6.0+)

The following phones/models have been verified to work well on various projects:

* Tecno Camon C9
* Huawei Y5 (2017) and Huawei Y6 Pro

Furthermore, the following are recommended:
* A 5" screen for usability
* A decently sized battery. For extended usage, it may be necessary to have battery packs
* Make sure to have enough charging options, such as car chargers and extension cords
