The HOT Toolbox is designed to provide the OSM Community with a repository of training materials, complete with step-by-step guides developed by the HOT training team. The material covers everything from setting up mobile devices to exporting OSM data for quality control and analysis.

In addition to consolidating HOT’s extensive training materials, this toolbox curates a large amount of other OSM resources that support mapping projects; from software guides to guidelines on running mapathons.
