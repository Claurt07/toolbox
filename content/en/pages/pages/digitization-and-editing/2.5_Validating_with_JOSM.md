## Overview

**Validation** is a process of checking the data quality (in this case, map data quality) for accuracy, consistency, completeness and anomaly. Validation is important to maintain the quality of OSM data. When checking for accuracy, you need to make sure that the map data is aligned with the imagery and is correct in terms of geometry. For consistency, make sure that all mapped objects are consistent in shape. For example, when you found a residential area, make sure all the buildings are consistently traced and orthogonalized. 

![Example of data validation](/images/validation/validation_1.png "example of data validation")

For completeness, it depends on what information you want to collect when mapping and what mapping method is used. Information collected using remote mapping method would be different with the information collected by conducting field survey. Information collected using remote mapping method will be very limited since you only have satellite imagery and gpx tracks available as reference. For anomaly, make sure there is no abnormal looking mapped objects. See the picture below, the mapped buildings on the left tends to be smaller than the mapped buildings on the right. After carefully checking the imagery, it turns out that the smaller buildings are actually tombs that are mapped as buildings.

While light validation can be completed using iD Editor, HOT recommends that detailed validation be completed using JOSM.

**Skills and Technology Needed**

* Computer
* Internet connection (for data download)
* [OSM account](https://github.com/hotosm/toolbox/wiki/1.2-Opening-OSM-accounts)
* [JOSM](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/digitization-and-editing/3.4-editing-with-id-and-josm/)
* Example .osm file


**Estimated time for completion:** 1 hour


**Objectives:**



*   To be able to understand validation process for OSM data
*   To be able to perform validation using Validation Tools on JOSM
*   To be able to fix commonly error, warning and mistake found during validation

**1. Opening OSM Data**

After successfully downloaded sample data, open file **validation_sample.osm** into your JOSM by following these steps:

*   Click menu **File** ➝ **Open**

 ![JOSM Menu File](/images/validation/validation_5.png "JOSM Menu File")
 <p align="center"><i>JOSM Menu File</i></p>


*   Go to your directory where you save validation_sample.osm. Select the file **validation_sample.osm** and then click **Open**.

 ![Opening an osm file on JOSM](/images/validation/validation_6.png "Opening an osm file on JOSM")
 <p align="center"><i>Opening an osm file on JOSM</i></p>


*   After opening the exercise file, your JOSM will look like this:
   

 ![Exercise file on JOSM](/images/validation/validation_7.png "Exercise file on JOSM")
 <p align="center"><i>Exercise file on JOSM</i></p>


**2. Using JOSM Validation Tools**

JOSM provides a built-in validator that checks and fixes invalid map data called Validation Tools. After checking for accuracy, consistency, completeness and anomaly, run this validation tools so that the map data is perfectly valid. To get started with the Validation tools, you need to activate the Validation Results Windows by following these steps:



*   Click menu **Windows** ➝ **Validation Results**

 ![Windows menu on JOSM](/images/validation/validation_3.png "Windows Menu on JOSM")
 <p align="center"><i>Windows menu on JOSM</i></p>


*   Validation results Windows will appear on the left side of your JOSM
  
 ![Validation results Windows](/images/validation/validation_4.png "Validation results Windows")
 <p align="center"><i>Validation results Windows</i></p>


After activating the Validation Results Windows, now you can start validation using JOSM Validation Tools. Download OSM data first using either Slippy Map or Tasking Mananger, then you can click the Validation button in the Validation Results Windows. Let’s use [OSM data sample](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13QgUDeoBA7uLSUkjsK8cEFsadmjpbNg_/view) for exercise.

*   To run validation on all the data in the current data layer, which is validation_sample.osm, make sure that there is no data selected. Then, click **Validation** button in the Validation Results Windows. Once the validation process is finished, Validation Results Windows will be filled with listed errors and warnings. The amount of errors and warnings found depends on the quality of the data. For example, on this OSM data sample, you will find one error and twenty one warnings.    

 ![Validation Results  from OSM Data Sample](/images/validation/validation_8.png "Validation Results  from OSM Data Sample")
 <p align="center"><i>Validation Results  from OSM Data Sample</i></p>
 


*   A new layer called Validation errors will also be added to the Layers Windows. This layer will highlight the errors and warnings found - red highlight for errors and yellow highlight for warnings.

 ![Highlighted errors and warnings](/images/validation/validation_9.png "Highlighted errors and warnings")
 <p align="center"><i>Highlighted errors and warnings</i></p>


**3. Fixing Errors and Warnings**

Errors are important to fix. Do not ignore errors. If you have errors on your OSM data, you won’t be able to upload it into OSM Server until you fix the errors. Some errors can be fixed automatically using the Fix button on Validation Results Windows. Warnings are problems that are important to fix, but in some cases, such as “Unnamed Ways”, they are tolerable. Mostly, warning should be fixed manually. Now, let’s try to fix errors and warnings found on *validation_sample.osm*. There are one error and twenty one warnings found on *validation_sample.osm*. They are:

*   Error: Duplicated ways (1)
*   Warning: Building inside building (4)
*   Warning: Crossing building/highway (1)
*   Warning: Crossing buildings (1)
*   Warning: Crossing highways (1)
*   Warning: deprecated tagging - amenity=hotel is deprecated, use tourism=hotel instead (1)
*   Warning: missing tag - incomplete object: only name (1)
*   Warning: node connects highway and building (1)
*   Warning: Overlapping highways (1)
*   Warning: Unclosed way - building (1)
*   Warning: Unnamed ways (6)
*   Warning: Untagged ways (1)
*   Warning: Way end node near other highway (2)

Now, let’s fix all the errors and warnings one by one.

**3.1 Fixing Error: Duplicated ways**

Duplicated ways error come up when there are ways that duplicate. This is usually caused by unstable internet connection when uploading OSM data into OSM server. Initially, to fix errors or warning, you should select the error or warning you want to fix. Go to the Duplicated ways error in the Validation Result Windows, click the **+** icon so that it looks like the picture below.

 ![Duplicated objects on Validation Results](/images/validation/validation_10.png "Duplicated objects on Validation Results")
 <p align="center"><i>Duplicated objects on Validation Results</i></p>



Select the objects where it is duplicated and **Right-click** ➝ **Zoom to problem** to zoom and see the duplicated objects. Your map canvas will zoom in to the duplicated objects. Fortunately, duplicated ways can be automatically fixed. After selecting the duplicated objects, click **Fix**. Voila, your error is fixed!

 <p align="center"><i>Zooming to Error: Duplicated ways</i></p>


**3.2 Fixing Warning: Building inside building**

Building inside building warning come up when there is a building object inside another building object. To fix it, go to the building inside building warning in the Validation Results Windows, click the **+** icon so that it looks like the picture below.

 ![Building inside building on Validation Results](/images/validation/validation_12.png "Building inside building on Validation Results")
 <p align="center"><i>Building inside building on Validation Results</i></p>

Select the objects listed under the warning Building inside building and **Right-click** ➝ **Zoom to problem** to zoom and see the objects. Your map canvas will zoom in to the objects.

 ![Zooming to Warning: Building inside building](/images/validation/validation_13.png "Zooming to Warning: Building inside building")
 <p align="center"><i>Zooming to Warning: Building inside building</i></p>

Most of warning should be fixed manually. To fix building inside building, simply delete one of the buildings. To decide which one to be deleted, please take a look at the imagery and carefully decide which one to be deleted. Voila, you just fixed a building inside building.

 ![](/images/validation/validation_16.png "Zooming to Warning: Crossing building/highway")
 <p align="center"><i>Zooming to Warning: Crossing building/highway</i></p> 

To fix crossing building/highway, simply move one of the crossed objects, either the building or the segment/node of the highway. To decide which object that should be moved, please take a look at the imagery.

 ![](/images/validation/validation_17.png "Fixing a crossing building/highway warning")
 <p align="center"><i>Fixing a crossing building/highway warning</i></p>


**3.4 Fixing Warning: Crossing buildings**

Crossing buildings warning come up when there are two or more buildings overlapped with each other. To fix it, go to the crossing buildings warning in the Validation Results Windows, click the **+** icon so that it looks like the picture below.

 ![Crossing buildings on Validation Results](/images/validation/validation_18.png "Crossing buildings on Validation Results")
 <p align="center"><i>Crossing buildings on Validation Results</i></p>

 ![Zooming to Warning: Crossing buildings](/images/validation/validation_19.png "Zooming to Warning: Crossing buildings")
 <p align="center"><i>Zooming to Warning: Crossing buildings</i></p>

To fix crossing buildings, simply move one of the overlapped buildings so that they wont be overlapping anymore. To decide which buildings that should be moved, please take a look at the imagery.

 ![Fixing a crossing buildings warning](/images/validation/validation_20.png "Fixing a crossing buildings warning")
 <p align="center"><i>Fixing a crossing buildings warning</i></p>


**3.5 Fixing Warning: Crossing highways**

Crossing highways warning come up when there are highways that cross each other with no crossing node. To fix it, go to  the crossing highways warning in the Validation Results Windows, click the **+** icon so that it looks like the picture below.

 ![Crossing highways on Validation Results](/images/validation/validation_21.png "Crossing highways on Validation Results")
 <p align="center"><i>Crossing highways on Validation Results</i></p>

 ![Zooming to Warning: Crossing highways](/images/validation/validation_22.png "Zooming to Warning: Crossing highways")
 <p align="center"><i>Zooming to Warning: Crossing highways</i></p>
 
To fix crossing highways, simply add a crossing node in the highway intersection. To add node at intersection, you can use JOSM additional tools, but first you have to activate plugin utilsplugins2. You can go to menu **Preferences **➝ **Plugins**, search for utilsplugins2 and give a check for utilsplugin2.

 ![Activating plugin utilsplugins2](/images/validation/validation_23.png "Activating plugin utilsplugins2")
 <p align="center"><i>Activating plugin utilsplugins2</i></p>

To add node at intersection, select the two crossing highways, and go to menu **More tools** ➝ **Add nodes at intersections**. And voila, your crossing highways now have a crossing node.

 ![Adding node at intersection](/images/validation/validation_24.png "Adding node at intersection")
 <p align="center"><i>Adding node at intersection</i></p>

**3.6 Fixing Warning: deprecated tagging**

Deprecated tagging warning come up when there is an object or more in your OSM data that used deprecated tagging. To fix it, go to  the deprecated tagging warning in the Validation Results Windows, click the **+** icon so that it looks like the picture below.

 ![Deprecated tagging on Validation Results](/images/validation/validation_25.png "Deprecated tagging on Validation Results")
 <p align="center"><i>Deprecated tagging on Validation Results</i></p>

Select the objects listed under the warning deprecated tagging and **Right-click** ➝ **Zoom to problem** to zoom and see the objects. Your map canvas will zoom in to the objects.

 ![Zooming to Warning: deprecated tagging](/images/validation/validation_26.png "Zooming to Warning: deprecated tagging")
 <p align="center"><i>Zooming to Warning: deprecated tagging</i></p>

Fortunately, deprecated tagging can be fixed automatically using Fix button. After selecting the object that has deprecated tagging, press the **Fix **button. JOSM will automatically change the deprecated tag into the new one.

 ![Fixing deprecated tagging](/images/validation/validation_27.png "Fixing deprecated tagging")
 <p align="center"><i>Fixing deprecated tagging</i></p>


**3.7 Fixing Warning: missing tag**

Missing tag warning come up when there is one or more objects that have no tag or the tag is incomplete. To fix it, go to the missing tag warning in the Validation Results Windows, click the **+** icon so that it looks like the picture below.

 ![Missing tag on Validation Results](/images/validation/validation_28.png "Missing tag on Validation Results")
 <p align="center"><i>Missing tag on Validation Results</i></p>

Select the objects listed under the warning missing tag and **Right-click** ➝ **Zoom to problem** to zoom and see the objects. Your map canvas will zoom in to the objects.

 ![Zooming to Warning: missing tag](/images/validation/validation_29.png "Zooming to Warning: missing tag")
 <p align="center"><i>Zooming to Warning: missing tag</i></p>

In this case, the object “Monrovia Park” only has tag name. It does not have the tag that identify it as park. What you have to do is simply add a tag to define that it is a park, named Monrovia Park. To add tag, click menu **Presets** ➝ **Search preset…** and search for Park. Select one that suits the kind of park you map, in this case you can select Geography/Landuse/Park, then click **Select**. Leave the name as is, then click **Apply Preset**.

 <p align="center"><i>Fixing node connects highway and building warning</i></p>


**3.9 Fixing Warning: Overlapping highways**

Overlapping highways come up when there are highways overlapping each other. To fix it, go to the overlapping highways warning in the Validation Results Windows, click the **+** icon so that it looks like the picture below.

 ![Overlapping highways on Validation Results](/images/validation/validation_36.png "Overlapping highways on Validation Results")
 <p align="center"><i>Overlapping highways on Validation Results</i></p>

Select the objects listed under the warning overlapping highways and **Right-click** ➝ **Zoom to problem** to zoom and see the objects. Your map canvas will zoom in to the objects.

 ![Zooming to Warning: Overlapping highways](/images/validation/validation_37.png "Zooming to Warning: Overlapping highways")
 <p align="center"><i>Zooming to Warning: Overlapping highways</i></p>

To fix this warning, firstly you should split the overlapped segment of the highway. Select one end node where the highways are overlapped, then click menu **Tools** ➝ **Split way** or **press P** on keyboard for shortcut. Selet the other end node where the highways are overlapped, and then menu **Tools** ➝ **Split way** or **press P** on keyboard again. Now the overlapped segment have splitted. All you have to do now is to delete the overlapped segment by selecting the segment and then press delete on your keyboard.

 <p align="center"><i>Fixing overlapping highways warning</i></p>


**3.10 Fixing Warning: Unclosed way - building**

Unclosed way - building warning come up when there is one or more buildings drawn as unclosed polygon. This happens when you draw building manually using node tools without building tools and the first node and the last node are not merged. To fix it, go to the unclosed way - building warning in the Validation Results Windows, click the **+** icon so that it looks like the picture below.

 ![Unclosed way - building on Validation Results](/images/validation/validation_39.png "Unclosed way - building on Validation Results")

 <p align="center"><i>Fixing unclosed way - building warning</i></p>


**3.11 Fixing Warning: Unnamed ways**

Unnamed ways warning come up when there is one or more highways (main road) that do not have names. This warning is one of the tolerable warning, so you can just ignore this. If you know the name of the road, you can add the road’s name by adding tag name to the road. However, if you do not know the name, please just leave it as is rather than giving a random name that could be misleading. To ignore this warning, you can just leave it as is or you can also put it on your Ignore list so that this warning does not come up when you perform validation in the future. Click the “Unnamed Ways” warning in the warning list, then click **Ignore** and click **Whole Group**.

 ![Putting a warning into Ignore List](/images/validation/validation_42.png "Putting a warning into Ignore List")
 <p align="center"><i>Putting a warning into Ignore List</i></p>

You can always put it back to your warning list if you change your mind, so that this warning will come up again when you perform validation by clicking **Manage Ignore**, then **right-click** on the warning you want to put back and choose **Don’t Ignore**.

 ![Managing Ignore List](/images/validation/validation_43.png "Managing Ignore List")
