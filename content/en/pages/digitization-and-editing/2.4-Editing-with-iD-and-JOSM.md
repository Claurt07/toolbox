## Overview
There are several ways to edit in OpenStreetMap. The two most commonly used tools and best programs for mapping projects are iD editor and JOSM. This section provides an overview of each tool as well as presentations to be used in trainings. For self-paced materials and guides, visit [LearnOSM](https://learnosm.org/en/).

iD Editor is best for:

* Simple edits
* Fast Internet access to load the imagery and save the edits.
* Following a consistent and simple tagging scheme.
* When you are restricted from installing a program on the computer you are using.

**Skills and Technology Needed:**

* Computer
* Mouse
* Strong Internet connection
* OSM account

#### JOSM

**JOSM** (Java OpenStreetMap Editor) is an open source editor for OpenStreetMap data with offline compatibility.

JOSM is best for:

* Adding many buildings (See buildings_tool plugin).
* Editing many polygons or lines that already exist.
* When you are on an unreliable Internet connection or offline.
* Using a specific tagging scheme (or custom presets).

**Skills and Technology Needed:**

* Computer
* Mouse
* Minimal/intermittent internet connection for data download & upload
* OSM account
* Installation files (Recommended: download installation files for offline sharing and installation)
   * [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) (Install this file before installing JOSM)
   * [Java OpenStreetMap Editor Installer](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/)
