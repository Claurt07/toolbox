Effective **Field Mapping Management** - knowing when, where, and what data is collected by each team member - is critical to ensuring that mapping efforts are done in a timely and safe manner with high quality and completeness. Additionally, field supervisors and team members will need the skills to set-up and manage field data collection tools. This section provides guides for setting up and using three tools: OpenDataKit, OpenMapKit, and OSMTracker. <br>
