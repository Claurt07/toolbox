**2. Set the Image Size**

In addition to the location point, you can also take a picture as additional information. If you will be collecting images as part of your data collection surveys, you can set the picture resolution as desired. But, the picture resolution will also affect the amount of your phone memory or file which will be uploaded to the server later. It is recommended that you choose the smallest resolution of the image during initial setup. You can follow this step: 

*   Open ODK Collect and press the three point button in the upper right corner, select **General Settings → Form Management**.
