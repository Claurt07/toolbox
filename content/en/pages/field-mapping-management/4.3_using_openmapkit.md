This guide provides **surveyors, mappers and field supervisors** with the skills to:

*   Configure OpenMapKit on devices for individual use and data collection
*   Operate _OpenMapKit_ for field data collection

<br>

## Overview
**OpenMapKit (OMK)** is an additional application that is used to support _ODK Collect_ in determining the position of objects found during precise and precise field surveys. _OpenMapKit_ can be run through _ODK Collect_, after you open and select one of the available forms. In determining the location of an object, _OpenMapKit_ requires a map background in the form of a satellite imagery or OSM map. If you use the OSM as the map background, the thing to note is that the data must be available on the OSM server. 

Prior to learning how to use **OpenMapKit**, users should know how to use _ODK (OpenDataKit) Collect,_ an android-based application to replace paper form for surveys as OpenMapKit is an extension of  _ODK Collect_. This extension is used to add information on the position or location of the object surveyed.

*If you have not yet completed the initial set-up OpenMapKit, see [3.2.2 Setting up OpenMapKit](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/3.2.2_setting_up_omk/) before proceeding.


## Resources and Training Materials
This section features a selection of resources targeted at project managers, trainers, or even self-learners on the topic(s) outlined above.

*The following section is designed to serve as a self-paced guides for project managers, supervisors, or others in setting up the application.*

### Configuring OpenMapKit

Before you use _OpenMapKit_, you must first make sure each device is confirgured. The following are step by step instructions of the initial OpenMapKit Configuration:

*   On the home page of _OpenMapKit_, press **the settings button** located in the upper right corner. This will allow you to download deployments (if applicable), select a basemap, and select the OSM buildings layer. 
  
![](/images/using-omk/omk_set-up.PNG)

#### 1. Deployments
If using OpenMapKit Server and deployments, follow these steps to download files needed for field mapping. If not using deployments, skip to *2. Basemap*.

*  Open the OpenMapKit app, tap on the Settings button in the top right corner, and select Deployments [1].
*  Select the appropriate deployment (i.e. census-versalles). Select the black download button in the lower right corner.

#### 2. Basemaps 

By default, _OpenMapKit_ will display the _Online Humanitarian OpenStreetMap_ that can be accessed using an internet connection. However, if manually added to the device or downloaded through a deployment, an offline basemap can be opened without an internet connection. 

Select and change the _OpenMapKit basemap_ by pressing **the settings button** located in the top right corner and pressing **_Basemap_** then select the _.mbtiles_. Then press **_OK_**.

#### 3. OSM Buildings Layer

**Selecting an installed OSM File** <br>
Open the OpenMapKit app, tap on the Settings button in the top right corner, and select OSM XML Layer [3]. Select the correct .osm layer for the locality that is being worked in. 

**Downloading OSM file** <br>
If your device does not have an OSM buildings layer (.osm file) pre-loaded or a file was not downloaded with a deployment, users can still download an OSM buildings layer with an internet connection. Users will need to complete the following steps: 

   *   Navigate the map to your current location (for example, you are already on the survey location) by pressing **the round button** in the lower right corner of the screen until the round button is colored blue. A black dot will appear at your current location.

![Navigate to the current location in OpenMapKit](/images/using-omk/0305_omk_location.png)
<p align="center"><i>Navigate to the current location in OpenMapKit</i></p>

   *   Press the **settings button** in the top right corner

   *   Select **_OSM XML Downloader_** to start download OSM data according to the view on the screen of your smartphone (the duration depends on the size of the area). Make sure you are connected to an internet connection when downloading OSM data. Note the color of the building, the building on the OSM _basemap _have brown color and the building from **_OSM XML Downloader _** is purple.


![Building colors](/images/using-omk/0306_warna_bangunan.png)
<p align="center"><i>Building color on the OSM basemap (left) and downloaded building color (right)</i></p>

   *   Your new downloaded OSM data will be saved in the format _.osm_ which can be activated or deactivated via **the settings button** **→ _OSM XML Layer_**.

#### 4. Enter OSM Username

   Select **OSM _User name_** OSM and enter your _User Name_

### Using OpenMapKit

Once you have configured your basemap and OSM layer, you can add the building information by:

   *   Select the building to which the information will be added. Make sure the building is purple which indicates that the building has been downloaded from OSM. If the building is selected, the color will change to orange.
  
   *   You can fill the building information in accordance with the form you have chosen before in the _ODK Collect_ application, with press the information tag in the first row located below.

![Fill out building information using a form from ODK Collect](/images/using-omk/0308_mengisi_form_omk.png)
<p align="center"><i>Fill out building information using a form from ODK Collect.</i></p>

   *   When done, at the end of the page select **_Save_** to save the form to _ODK Collect_. If you have completed filling in the form, the building that you fill in the information will look like this:

![The building that has been filled in the information](/images/using-omk/0309_tag_bangunan_omk.png)
<p align="center"><i>Building that has been filled in the information</i></p>  


If the building data for location of your survey is not yet available in the OSM, you can map the building before conducting the survey. If you don’t have time to do the mapping, you can use points to mark the object in the _OpenMapKit_ by:
  
   *   Press **the plus (+) icon** in the lower right corner of your screen until it turns green. It will appear green marker with the words _Add Node_ on it. Slide the map until the location of the marker is accurate with the object in the field.

![Add marker using plus icon](/images/using-omk/0310_add_node_omk.png)
<p align="center"><i>Add markers using the plus (+) icon</i></p>

   *   Press **_Add Node_** if the point is accurate

![Add node button when adding a point](/images/using-omk/0311_tombol_add_node.png)
<p align="center"><i>Add note button when add point</i></p>

   *   If the point you add turns out to be in a position that is not in represent with the object in the field, you can move the point that has been added by clicking on the point to move then press the two arrow icon in the top right corner. The color of the point will turn orange and above it will be appear _Place Node_.
     
![Swipe points that have been added](/images/using-omk/0312_menggeser_node.png)
<p align="center"><i>Swipe points that have been added</i></p>

   *   Slide the map to the accurate point position, then press **_Place Node_**.

![Place node button when shifting a point](/images/using-omk/0313_place_node.png)
<p align="center"><i>Place node button when shifting a point</i></p>
    
   *   After the position is accurate as the object in the field, you can fill out the form the same as the previous step.
  
   *   Enter information that matches the conditions in the field. Swipe the screen right or left to change thepage questionon the form.

   *   At the end of the page, select **_Save_** to save the form to _ODK Collect_. If you finished to fill in forms, the marker that you fill in the information will look like this:

![the point of objects already loaded with informations](/images/using-omk/0314_finished_tag.png)
<p align="center"><i>Point of objects already loaded with informations</i></p>

   *   Now you can see the form has been successfully saved on the _ODK Collect_.
   
*Note: all OpenMapKit surveys will be launched from the ODK application.*
