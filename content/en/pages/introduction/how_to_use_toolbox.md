title : How to use the HOT Toolbox
weight : 1
---

The HOT Toolbox is designed to take a project manager or community through the entire mapping workflow, from planning, through initial mapping, data use and analysis. Not every mapping project is the same. Some projects involve extensive field data collection components, others might not even conduct field mapping activities but run desktop-based digitization projects instead. 

The **Toolbox** has seven sections (overview below) that can be used in the order presented, or combined to suit your individual project training needs.

If you do not want to go through each section, use the left-hand navigation, or the search bar to look for a particular guide. 

**If you are not sure where to begin a project** use the **Mapping Project Workflows** section to find an example workflow that best suits your projectâ€™s goals and resources. Each example will guide you through the exact steps, while linking to the relevant sections in the Toolbox and highlighting the tools and processes used.

## Overview of the Toolbox Sections

1. **Designing and Coordinating a Mapping Project** provides readers with an introduction to the components that project managers should consider and take into account before beginning their mapping projects.  
2. **Digitization and Editing in OSM** provides project managers with training materials and guides on managing the digitization process and which remote mapping tools are best for a project. 
3. **Field Mapping Technical Set-up** provides project managers with the technical steps for selecting which mobile data collection application is best for their project, setting up those applications (such as ODK and OMK) for use in the field, and whether or not data collection servers are necessary for their project. 
4. **Field Mapping Management** provides steps and guides for field mappers and supervisors to use mobile data collection applications, as well as providing tips for managing teams in the field. 
5. **Data Cleaning Upload and Quality Assurance** covers the process of taking field mapped data through cleaning and upload to OpenStreetMap while ensuring strong data quality. 
6. **Data Export Tools** covers the various tools used for exporting data from OpenStreetMap and which tools are best for different use cases. 
7. **Data Use and Analysis** provides an introduction to how data can be turned into effective maps for decision making.
