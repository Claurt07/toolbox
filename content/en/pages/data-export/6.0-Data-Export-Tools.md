**Data Export Tools** allow users to download OSM data for use and analysis programs such as [QGIS](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/data-use-and-analysis/7.1-qgis/). The following are Data Export Tools commonly used in the HOT workflow. For more information on how to use these tools, follow the step-by-step guides in each of the following sections. 

* [6.1 HOT Export Tool](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/data-export/6.1-hot-export-tool/) covers the HOT Export Tool which allows users to download OSM data by specifying tags, area of interest, and file type. 

* [6.2 Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/data-export/6.2-hdx/) covers the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) data platform for storing and sharing humanitarian data managed by OCHA's Centre for Humanitarian Data.  

* Information on [QuickOSM](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/data-use-and-analysis/7.1-qgis/#installing-plug-ins), a QGIS Plug-in that allows users to directly download OSM data for specific tags into QGIS, can be found in section 7.1 Introduction to QGIS.
