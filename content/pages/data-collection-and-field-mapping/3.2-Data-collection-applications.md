This section provides:  

*   An overview of data collection application options
*   Guidance on selecting a data collection application for your project needs 
*   Brief overviews of OpenDataKit, OpenMapKit, KoboCollect, and OSMTracker

<br>

## Overview 
Several mobile applications exist to assist with field data collection. Choosing an application to use depends on mobile device capability, varying set-up requirements, and survey needs. Options include [OpenDataKit](https://opendatakit.org/), [OpenMapKit](http://openmapkit.org/), [KoboCollect](https://www.kobotoolbox.org), [OSMTracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmtracker&hl=en_US), and [Maps.me](https://maps.me/)<br><br>

## Choosing a Data Collection Application

**Which data collection application should I use?** <br>
Use the following table to decide which application is best for your project and resource restrictions. These are not the only options available, but instead, applications that HOT has used and tested in the field for mapping projects.

### Open Data Kit (ODK) 
ODK is a free an open-source set of tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. ODK Collect is part of ODK and is an Android app that replaces paper forms used in survey-based data gathering. It supports a wide range of question and answer types, and is designed to work well without network connectivity.



**Skills and Technology Needed**

* Computer
* Internet Connection
* Mobile devices (see [1.3 Hardware](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/running-a-mapping-project/1.3-hardware/) for specifications.) 
* ODK forms
* Spreadsheet software (such as Excel or [LibreCalc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/))

**Use OpenDataKit (ODK) if:**

  * You have access to mobile devices but they have limited RAM & storage
  * You do not need to collect data for buildings in OSM OR you are able to manually transfer data collected as points to OSM polygons after data collection. 
  * You want or need to have an easy set-up option for data collection.

**Resources**

* OpenDataKit: https://opendatakit.org
* ODK Guide: https://docs.opendatakit.org/collect-intro
* ODK Build: https://build.opendatakit.org
* Building ODK Forms: http://xlsform.org/en

**Download**

* [Directly download via Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.odk.collect.android&hl=en_US)
* [Download APK to share and install offline](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect/releases/tag/v1.16.1)


**Set-up and use**

* For set-up, see [Section 3.2.1 Setting up OpenDataKit.](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/data-collection-and-field-mapping/3.2.2_setting_up_omk/)
* For use, see [Section 4.1 Using OpenDataKit.](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/field-mapping-management/5.1_using_odk_collect/)

### OpenMapKit (OMK) 

OMK is an extension that launches directly from within ODK Collect when the OSM question type is enabled in a standard survey. It is what allows you to browse OSM features, and to create and edit OSM tags. 



**Skills and Technology Needed**

* Computer
* Internet Connection
* Mobile devices (see [Hardware](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/running-a-mapping-project/1.5-hardware/) for specifications.) 
* [OMK forms](https://github.com/hotosm/toolbox/wiki/4.3-Creating-forms-(ODK-OMK))
* Spreadsheet software (such as Excel or [LibreCalc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/))
* Additional files
  * .mbtiles
  * OSM layer
  * Constraint file
* Recommended: OMK Server

**Use OpenMapKit (OMK) if:** 

  * You have access to mobile devices with sufficient RAM & storage (see [1.3 Hardware](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/running-a-mapping-project/1.3-hardware/) for specifications.) 
  * You need to collect data for buildings in OSM
  * You have the capacity for more intensive set-up prior to data collection

**Download**

* [Directly download via Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.redcross.openmapkit&hl=en_US)

* Internet Connection (for application download)
* Mobile devices (see [Hardware](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/running-a-mapping-project/1.5-hardware/) for specifications.) 

**Download**

* [Directly download via Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmtracker&hl=en_US)
