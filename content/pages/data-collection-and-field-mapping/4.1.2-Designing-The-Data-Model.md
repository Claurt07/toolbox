title : 4.1.2 Designing The Data Model
---

## Tagging
Tags are used in OSM to categorize features, and to add information that is useful for:

* Understanding of the map
* Planning
* Routing
* Querying

OSM doesnâ€™t work with layers or attribute tables, but tags. Each tag consists of a key, and a value. Each map feature should have 1 or more tags Such as:

* building=residential
* highway=primary
* amenity=school

### Resources

- Check the [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features). Start at the Map features page, search, and discover!
- Research tag use and occurence on [TagInfo](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/)

## Data Models
A data model defines what features are surveyed or mapped and what attributes are collected for each feature.
If a project will upload data to OpenStreetMap, the data model should be designed to match OSM tagging. 

### Example data models

- [Uganda Refugee Crisis](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Uganda/Uganda_Crowdsourcing_Non-Camp_Refugee_Data)
- [Ramani Huria](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Dar_es_Salaam/Ramani_Huria)
