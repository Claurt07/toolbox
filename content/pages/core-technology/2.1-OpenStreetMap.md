[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a collaborative project to create a free editable world map and is at the core of HOT's mapping activities. You are free to use it for any purpose as long as you credit OSM and its contributors.

You can think of OSM as the “Wikipedia of maps” – it is an online database and global community of over 4 million registered users. This community collaborates to build a free and open map of the world to which anyone can contribute and which anyone can use in their own context. The first organized use of OSM in disaster response was following the 2010 Haiti Earthquake. As high-resolution imagery of the affected area was made available to the public, over 600 individuals from the global OSM community began digitizing the imagery and tracing roads and other infrastructure. They made what quickly became the most detailed map of Port-au-Prince in existence, which was then used by search and rescue teams to help route supplies around the devastated capital and to coordinate many other aspects of the response and reconstruction effort.
