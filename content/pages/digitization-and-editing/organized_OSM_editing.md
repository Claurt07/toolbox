Before starting any mapping project, it is important to assess, and if necessary, update the OpenStreetMap basemap through remote mapping. This remote mapping process helps ensure that the buildings and roads used during a field mapping phase are up to date, improving the quality and effectiveness of field mapping efforts. For example, using remote mapping, your team can identify buildings or entire villages that might have been missed otherwise.  

While the anticipated project workflow influences the area to be remotely mapped, it is important to note that the budget and time available may place restrictions on what is feasible to be digitized. In this way, remote mapping can also influence the workflow, making the remote mapping plan an important part of the planning process.

No matter the scope of your project you will need to determine:

*  [Who will be digitizing for your project?](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/digitization-and-editing/organized_osm_editing/#sourcing-your-remote-mappers)
*  [Do Organized Editing Guidelines requirements apply to you?](https://hotosm.github.io/toolbox/pages/digitization-and-editing/organized_osm_editing/#organised-editing-compliance-procedures)
*  

## Sourcing your remote mappers
Remote mapping takes time and effort. This process can take several different forms ranging from being quickly completed with a few volunteer mappers for a small area to an organized, paid team working for several months to complete a region. The resources and time needed to map your area of interest depends on:

* **Size of your area of interest**: Are you mapping one city or an entire district? 
* **Timeline**: Does the area need to be mapped in a few weeks? Months?
* **Available resources**: Does your project have budget to pay digitizers and validators?
* **Features and attributes**: Does your project require only buildings to be mapped? Roads? Will any features (such as roof:material) be added by remote mappers?



Whenever possible, we recommend sourcing local mappers to be part of the digitization efforts. And remember, it is critical that no matter what plan you choose, that it includes a validation and quality control plan!

## Organised Editing Compliance Procedures

_HOT’s suggested procedures for complying with the Organised Editing Guidelines (OEG) - Draft February-June 2019_


### Purpose:

What problem(s) does the OEG aim to address, and how can we best comply with, and address, these concerns?



*   **Transparency** - the OEG attempts to make it easier for local mappers to know what organizations are editing in their area.
*   **Communication** - the OEG attempts to make it easier for local mappers to communicate with organized editors and editing teams.
*   **Conflict Resolution** - the OEG attempts to provide a basis for coordinating, as well as a mechanism for local communities to form a complaint against an organized editing activity.


### Documentation:



*   The official OEG can be found here: [https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Organised_Editing_Guidelines](https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Organised_Editing_Guidelines) 
*   The official OEG Activities page here: [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities) 
*   The HOT OEG Activities page here: [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities/Humanitarian_OpenStreetMap_Team](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities/Humanitarian_OpenStreetMap_Team) 


### Requirements: 

What exactly is required by the Organized Editing Guidelines (OEG)?



1. Project Documentation on the [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities/Humanitarian_OpenStreetMap_Team):
    * Organisation and contact info 
        * description and link to organization
        * a way to contact the project manager or team
    * Project details 
        * _the goal and purpose of the activity_
        * _the timeframe for the activity_
        * _any non-standard tools and data sources used, and their usage conditions_
        * _links where the community can access any non-standard tools or data sources_
    * Standard changeset comment
        * specific hashtag for tracking
        * link to related organized editing activity
    * Team information
        * the accounts of participating persons _that wish to be identified_, with any details they wish to include
        * _if participants will receive training material or written instructions, a copy of, or link to, these materials_
            1. links to organized editing organization(s) and activity(ies) on user profile
            2. sufficient training for project (i.e. local tagging schemas, etc.)
        * _if the success or performance of participants will be measured in any way, a description of the metrics used for this_
2. Project Execution and Follow-up
    * Communication with the local community
        * 2 week notice for non-emergency projects, open forum/mailing list
        * 2 working day response for community inquiries throughout project
    * Plans for a “_post-event clean up_” to validate edits, _especially if the activity introduces new contributors to OpenStreetMap_.
    * _After the activity has completed, or at least once a month for ongoing efforts, a description of the results_.


#### Does this apply to me?


[insert graphic]


#### Common Elements:

_Common elements of projects can be jointly-documented among projects._ 

For HOT, most projects fall under OEG compliance, and will share the following:



*   The organization and contact information
*   Instructions to a certain degree, i.e. basic mapping covered with LearnOSM materials
*   A somewhat standard validation process; of course be explicit about any ground truthing
*   Somewhat standardized tool set(s) (i.e. TM for Remote, ODK/OMK for ground)
*   Reports/descriptions/news at a central location (i.e. HOT website)


### Step-by-Step Process:



1. **Project Pre-launch**
    * Have at least a skeleton wiki/web-page ready to share with local community
        * How to edit the wiki: [https://learnosm.org/en/intermediate/editing-the-wiki/](https://learnosm.org/en/intermediate/editing-the-wiki/)
        * See [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Template:Activation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Template:Activation) for a template/example of Activation wiki-pages
        * How to create HOT Website projects
    * Local contact made a minimum of 2 weeks prior of launch; through their open mailing-list, or forum, most likely to contact the key leaders in the community
        * Look here for mailing lists: [https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo)
        * Search wiki by country as they may have other communication channels listed there, and sometimes individual points of contact
        * And try [https://github.com/osmlab/osm-community-index](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-community-index)
        * Only if you exhaust these options is it acceptable to assume no local community
    * Set-up OSM User Profiles:
        * Consider registering team on OSM with designated usernames
            1. Can still be personalized, such as JaneDoe_Validator, JohnDoe_Mapper, etc.
        * Consider also using organization email account(s)
            2. Ideally, the Project Manager or Team Lead should get, or be able to access all messaging. If a mapper leaves, but then gets messages from the community, you will want to be able to reply
        10. All profiles should at least have a link to the OEG project page, organizations website, or (for HOT) preferably a link to the individual’s profile on the website
2. **Project Launch**
    * Ensure the project has an entry in [OEG activities page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities/Humanitarian_OpenStreetMap_Team) 
    * Have the required details of your plan in a wiki-page or (for HOT) a hotosm.org website project-page
    * Appoint one or two people that will handle rapid replying to all community traffic (2 business day max)
    * Periodic Reports are typically handled through blog (for HOT), but can also consider posting results on wiki’s, etc.
3. **Project Completion**
    * Make sure there is a plan to finish any remaining validation and that is communicated to the local community.
    * With constant communication with the local community throughout the project, it should be fairly easy and straightforward to determine when the project will be done and the Community is back on their own, with conduits to project org(s).
    * Before closing your project out, make sure there is a final blog-post or report documenting the closure.
        * Doc/report does not need to be full report requested by a donor, as example, but generally the results: successful or not, lessons learned
        * Last, move your row in the OEG Activities table from Active to Previous
